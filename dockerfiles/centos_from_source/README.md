## CentOS from Source ##

This directory contains dockerfiles that build software from source
upon the latest CentOS. In most cases, images built from these files
will contain much more recent software than their counterparts that
use packages. These builds are more complex, but allow for more
explicit feature specifications. In particular, keeping the netCDF
and HDF5 versions compatible should be easier with these files.
