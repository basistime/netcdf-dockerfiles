# netCDF Dockerfiles #
> Dockerfiles for building images that support netCDF use and development

This is a simple repository of dockerfiles for building images that
support netCDF development.

Currently, the files here produce three types of images:
* Builds from packages onto the latest CentOS
* Builds from source onto the latest CentOS
* Builds from source onto Alpine Linux

Containers from these images can be used in interactive and
non-interactive processes.

## Usage ##

For the unfamiliar, these files are instructions to Docker that
tell it how to build _images_ from which _containers_ may be generated.

If this is all new to you, it would be best to read about Docker here:
https://www.docker.com/

Detailed instructions for getting started and using Docker can be found
here:
https://docs.docker.com/
